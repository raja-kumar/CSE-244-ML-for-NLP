Here I have implemented the word2vec and glove embedding model from scratch only using python and numpy. 

### Dataset

you should download the training data from http://mattmahoney.net/ dc/text8.zip. Here is a description of the text8 dataset http://mattmahoney.net/dc/.

Download test vocab file from here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RrLF-ee-b2DmnpKjS0cZrsMjxfbTfsSl/view?usp=sharing

Download and copy both the files in this current directory

### Training

See [Glove](https://github.com/raja-kumar/CSE-244-ML-for-NLP/tree/main/asg1/glove) and [word2vec](https://github.com/raja-kumar/CSE-244-ML-for-NLP/tree/main/asg1/word2vec) for more details.
